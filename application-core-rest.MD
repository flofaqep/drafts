## General app structure
- The client side outer application frame is irrelevant at the moment
- Application has one entry point, further navigation is based on the options from the "server"
- The main structure is Poll { Question, List\<Answer\>}
## Primary hardcoded behavior
- Well defined sequence of logical polls to keep user "busy"
## Second level Smart behavior
- Build a Poll relevance graph helping with upcoming poll recommendations
